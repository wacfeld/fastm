hello.
as you can see my cursor is following into the html page.
math:
\(1+1+1+1\)
cooler math:
`x = (-b +- sqrt(b^sr - 4 ac))/(2a)` (is the quadratic formula)

the performance is not very good as you can see, but that can be solved by converting all the python scripts to C, which hasn't been done yet.

however, this is still awesome.
